## Commands
- right click: reveals the clicked cell
- left click: put a flag on top of the clicked cell

## Quick start
Make sure to setup sdl2 correctly if you don't have it already and to put sdl2 dlls in the root folder otherwise it won't work.
If you have never done it you can check sdl2 [crate.io](https://crates.io/crates/sdl2) page.
If you have everything necessary you can just:

```Console
cargo run
```
